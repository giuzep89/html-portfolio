    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I used to be into videogames as a kid. That, in turn, got me incredibly
      interested in computers and technology in general, so I started tweaking
      my pc, add new peripherals, fixing my friends' computers, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the following years I dedicated myself to music and ended up moving
      to the Netherlands to pursue this passion further with a Bachelor in Jazz
      saxophone at the Prins Claus Conservatorium of Groningen.

      Much as I loved music, I realized that I didn't relish the life of the
      freelance musician, and therefore decided to explore other fields. After a
      few years working as a janitor, I started dedicating myself to my other
      great love, that is languages, working as a translator and customer
      service representative for about 2 years

      After realizing I wanted to dedicate myself to something more challenging
      and creative, I decided to turn back to my early interest in technology by
      exploring the world of web development and coding in general. This is
      proving amusing and engaging in equal measure, and I can't wait to see
      what the future holds for me.
